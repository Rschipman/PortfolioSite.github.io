# Roan Chipman – Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The site is designed to showcase selected frontend projects with detailed case studies, focusing on clarity, usability, and thoughtful design decisions.

The portfolio is deployed using GitHub Pages and built with a mobile-first approach to ensure accessibility and performance across devices.

## Live Site

https://rschipman.github.io/PortfolioSite.github.io/

## Overview

Rather than functioning as a simple project gallery, this portfolio emphasizes case studies that explain the reasoning, challenges, and solutions behind each project. The goal is to provide clear insight into both my technical and design decision-making processes.

The structure is intentionally lightweight and framework-minimal to prioritize speed, maintainability, and ease of expansion.

## Built With

- HTML5 (semantic markup)
- Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- GitHub Pages (deployment)

* Minimal, intentional color palette
* Reliable internal navigation for GitHub Pages
* Simple structure that supports future growth
