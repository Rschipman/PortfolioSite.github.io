# Roan Chipman – Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The site showcases selected frontend projects through detailed case studies and provides a direct contact method for professional inquiries.

The portfolio is deployed using GitHub Pages and built with a mobile-first, accessibility-conscious approach.

## Contact Form

The contact form is powered by Formspree and works on GitHub Pages without a backend.

Features include:

* Client-side form submission via Fetch API
* Success and error messaging
* Honeypot field for basic spam protection
* No page reload on submission

Messages are delivered directly to my email inbox.
